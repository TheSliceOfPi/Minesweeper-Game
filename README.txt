Minesweeper is a simple game. The user is given the chance to choose a difficulty level [1(Easy) to 3(Difficult)]. Then they are presented with a board on their command line. They can choose what position they want to select. The game can go one of two ways. The user can either select on a mine and lose or select on an empty slot. In both cases, the user is presented with an updated board.If the user is able to select all empty slots, they win.
